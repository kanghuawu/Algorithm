# Cheatsheet

## Graph
* Inbound and outbound

## Shortest Paths
* Undirected graphs:
* Unweighted graphs: BFS
* No directed cycles (DAG): topological sort
* No negative weights: Dijkstra
* No negative cycles: Bellman-Ford

## String

### Radix sort
* LSD sort
* MSD sort
* 3-way radix sort
  * Combine of MSD and 3-way quicksort
* Suffix sort (enable fast substring search)
  * Substring + MSD sort
  * Manber-Myers algorithm
### Tries
* R-way tries
* Ternary search tries
  * R-way tries + Red-Black search trees
* TST with R2
### Substring search
* KMP (Knuth-Morris-Pratt) substring search
  * Deterministic finite state automaton (DFA)
