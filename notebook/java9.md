## Default Method Resolution

1. Classes always win. A method declaration in the class or a superclass takes prior- ity over any default method declaration.
2. Otherwise, sub-interfaces win: the method with the same signature in the most specific default-providing interface is selected. (If B extends A, B is more specific than A).
3. Finally, if the choice is still ambiguous, the class inheriting from multiple inter- faces has to explicitly select which default method implementation to use by overriding it and calling the desired method explicitly.

# Functional Interface

* Any interface with a SAM(Single Abstract Method) is a functional interface, and its implementation may be treated as lambda expressions.

* Note that Java 8â€™s default methods are not abstract and do not count: a functional interface may still have multiple default methods.
