Testing correctness of Percolation

Running 15 total tests.

Tests 1 through 8 create a Percolation object using your code, then repeatedly
open sites by calling open(). After each call to open(), it checks the return
values of isOpen(), percolates(), numberOfOpenSites(), and isFull() in that order.
Except as noted, a site is opened at most once.

9.6x too many calls.

Test 4: Create an n-by-n percolation system; interleave calls to open(),
        percolates(), isOpen(), isFull(), and numberOfOpenSites() until.
        the system percolates. The values of n go up by a factor of sqrt(2).
        The test is passed if n >= 4096.

     The approximate order-of-growth is n ^ (log ratio)
